# Unicode Transform

Implements the [Unicode transform rules](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-general.html#Transforms). This is particularly useful from transliterating from one script to another.

## Todo

* [ ] Case insensitive lookups for scripts

* [ ] (Unicode) mapping between CCC and its name

## Installation


```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_unicode_transform, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
